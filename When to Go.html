<h1><u>When to Go to Norway</u></h1>
<h2>The ideal time to visit Norway is from June to August when the weather is warm and the days are long. The country is at its liveliest during this time and locals take advantage of the good weather at every opportunity. The parks are always full, and there are usually fun events happening on the weekends. Temperatures are often in the 20s°C (60s and 70s°F) during the summer. Not too hot, but warm enough to swim, hike, and lounge about.</h2>
<h2>he shoulder season (May-June and August-September) makes for a good time to visit as well, with temperatures ranging from 4-10°C (40-50°F). May typically has decent weather with occasional rain, while September gives you cooler temperatures and changing leaves. You’ll beat the crowds and still be able to explore on foot without the weather getting in your way (too much).</h2>
<h2>Attractions begin to close around September/October (including some hiking trails). The days get dark early in October and temperatures start dropping around this time too. However, prices also decrease and you’re likely to find cheaper airfares and accommodations during this time. Be sure to pack layers (and rain gear) if you plan on visiting during this time of year as it can be quite cool — even during the day.</h2>
<h2>The winter is very cold and sees a lot of snow and darkness. Temperatures plummet below freezing. The advantage of traveling during the winter is that accommodation is cheaper and fees for certain attractions are lower. This is also the prime time to see the northern lights or go skiing, so there is still plenty to do if you plan on visiting during the winter.</h2>
