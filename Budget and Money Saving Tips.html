<h2>Norway is expensive. There’s no two ways about it. It’s one of the most expensive countries in the world and you will be hard pressed to save money if you aren’t cooking all your meals or camping. Ultra-budget is not impossible, just difficult. Here are some tips to help you save money in Norway:</h2>
<h2><u>Cook Your Own Food</u></h2>
<h3>Food is very expensive in Norway so the best thing you can do is cook your own meals. Go grocery shopping and stick to cheap local staples. Avoid eating out!</h3>
<h2><u>Couchsurf</u></h2>
<h3> Use Couchsurfing to connect with locals and get free accommodation. It’s the best way to save money and make new friends who can share their insider tips and advice.</h3>
<h2><u>Camp</u></h2>
<h3>Free public camping laws allow you to wild camp in the parks and public lands for free. You can generally stay 1-2 nights in an area as long as you are quiet and respectful. Make sure to leave the area as you found it!</h3>
<h2><u>Get a Tourism Card</u></h2>
<h3>The best way to afford all the attractions in a city is to get a city tourism card. Oslo and Bergen both have tourism cards that can save you money if you plan on seeing a lot (they include free public transportation too).</h3>
<h2><u>Book in Advance</u></h2>
<h3> If you can plan your transportation in advance, you can save up to 50% off the cost of your train or bus tickets. Buying last-minute tickets means it’s going to be more than any budget traveler can afford, especially if you want to visit a number of destinations in Norway. Book in advance and save money!</h3>
<h2><u>Travel With Friends</u></h2>
<h3> If you rent a car (which is the best way to get around) try to find people to join you to share costs. You can use the Couchsurfing platform or just ask around in hostels to find people. This will help you save money on gas and rental prices — which can eat into your budget quickly!</h3>
<h2><u>Take Advantange of Free Activities</u></h2>
<h3>While Norway is expensive, there are plenty of free activities to be enjoyed. Check out the festivals and free concerts held in Bergen’s church areas that attract many international musicians. Take advantage of free admission to the national parks and spend your days hiking outdoors in the fresh Nordic. Oslo might be an expensive capital but you can still wander around Ekebergparken park, the Intercultural museum, or visit some art galleries and ruins without breaking the bank.</h3>
<h2><u>Bring Reusable Water Bottle</u></h2>
<h3>The tap water in Norway is super clean, so bring a reusable water bottle to save money and lower your plastic usage.</h3>
